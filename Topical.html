            If you use social media, log into one of your accounts and have a look at the advertisements. Can you trace them back to web pages 
            you have visited or posts you have interacted with? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            The first thing the group did in this task was to log in to one of our Instagram accounts to see if any ads appeared about 
            something we have a relation to. That did indeed happen and after a while advertisement for coding appeared. This is interesting considering that in 
            recent weeks, coding related websites have been used in frequent sequences for school. After further investigations through the advertising, we arrived 
            at the website w3schools. This is a website that is mainly about coding, and is in fact a page all of us in the group have used before. 
            After this revelation, we were curious to see if it was deliberate enough for it to affect the other accounts, and so we moved on to the next person in the group's Instagram to see which ads appeared there. We came across several sources that were 
            football and fantasy football related, and when we went into more of the details we saw several sites that were familiar to us. 
            These were pages that have been used in the past by one or more in the group. The most reoccuring website from the ads is called Fantasy Premier League and is a page about fantasy football.
          </p>
          <p>
            We noticed that after we started studying IT, we received significant amounts of recommended code videos on Tiktok. 
            This appears regardless of whether we have searched for coding in Tiktok's search field. It is also experienced at times where someone 
            has talked about traveling abroad and then the advertisement recommends Trivago and other airlines afterwards. It creates a theory that 
            the phone is actively using the microphone to adapt ads, which is unexpected.

            SELECT ONE ETHICAL DILEMMA FROM EACH OF THE VIDEOS IN 6.4 MODULE AND DISCUSS IT WITHIN YOUR GROUP.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the first video, Anne-Sofie Ris√•sen talks about the car that is about to crash. What is ethically correct in this situation, 
            for our part, would have been to drive into the wall to avoid more injuries. We interpret that to mean that the driver was inattentive, 
            and that he is the one who caused the situation that occurred. In front of him is a child who has no fault in this situation and was 
            supposed to pass the road. Next to the child walks a businessman who is out and about his everyday life. It is the driver's fault in 
            the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the second video, Curt Rise talks about the human being unable to ignore the gender or ethnicity of the person speaking. 
            Ethically speaking, this is wrong because people should not be perceived differently by others considering something they cannot change. 
            We in the group believe that people evaluate others on a general basis, regardless of individual values, and this can be associated with 
            different cultures and which country they come from. People in different cultures can have perspectives on a topic and will naturally be 
            skeptical of others even when they have similar values.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the third video, Jutta Treviranus talks about when she was involved in a project to develop a driving assistant using artificial 
            intelligence. As we saw in the video, it didn't quite go according to plan. After some discussion among the group, we came to an ethical
            dilemma regarding the situation. Would it be ethically correct to continue the development of this type of Artificial Intelligence, 
            or is it correct to stop testing the technology completely. This comes after several attempts to adjust the function. 
            It did not get any better when it came to unconventional events that artificial intelligence is unable to calculate.
