            ACCESSIBILITY AND HOW WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT IN OUR CODE
          </h2>
          <div class="line-accessability"></div>
          <p>
            The main purpose of accessibility is to make sure that people with reduced abilities also have a chance of navigating the website. 
            Therefore, we tested the code using an automated test with a program called wave. Because of this, we came to realize the difference in contrast needed 
            for people with reduced sight as well as other small, but key differences found in our code. An example of this is the usage of access keys. We thought 
            it would be an access friendly implementation, but wave thought otherwise. It said that access keys often conflict with user or assistive technology which 
            is the opposite of what we want for the site. With this information in mind, we chose not to implement it after all.
          </p>

        <p> 
          Even though Wave certainly was of big help, we were already aware of certain points in accessibility which made it easy in terms of restructuring 
          and cleaning up code. We knew highly contrasted colors were a big factor in people's understanding of the website, which is why we used a 
          third-party website to check if the colors are vibrant enough for every aspect of colorblindness. Colorblind people are not the only ones 
          struggling with reduced ability. There are people with reduced eyesight as well. With this we tried to structure the webpage in a way which font sizes are big, 
          icons are implemented, and the infrastructure has minimal clutter. In the code itself we tried to use as many semantic elements as possible, this includes 
          elements such as "header", "nav", "section" etc. With the combination of grid and grid-template, it makes up to be a better experience for people that use 
          text to speech tools. Our images and controls have equivalent text alternatives with highly descriptive points and the video clip has an implemented volume 
          control and captions within the source which is why we did not feel the need to do that ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this design there would be low physical effort needed in a sense where everything is on the screen, and you would not need to hover over a specific button or text. 
          The navigational bar is static with minimal but enough content provided. We tried to avoid complex sentences and kept the deviations from the theme to a minimal.
